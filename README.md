# Robotic Scrub Nurse

A robotic scrub nurse has been developed to assist surgeon doctors during surgical interventions. The developed system in this work is equipped with a speech recognition module to recognize the requested surgical instrument; it locates this element on a storage tray using computer vision and pattern recognition and picks the element from the tray placing it on a destination tray where the human scrub nurse can finally use this tool. Moreover, to implement the manipulation of surgical instruments, an electromagnetic gripper has been adapted to pick and place them. T050000 Tinker kit Braccio robot has been electrically modified to add a new connector devoted to control the electromagnetic gripper.

## Proposed system

This video shows experiments on different places on the storage tray along with different surgical instruments.
